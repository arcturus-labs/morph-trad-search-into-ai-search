design a wireframe for me for a typical search application that relates to fashion - include search box and button, breadcrumb, "did you mean", facets on the left frame for various reasonable fashion things, search results in the middle with title, snippets
...

actually, fashion is not a good domain, I want a domain that is readily understandable, that has good facets that can be used as filters, that has a good breadcrumb taxonomy, but that involves text for search results because I also want to showcase highlighting and snippeting and other metadata

before we create anything help me brainstorm a better domain

Great thinking! Let's find a domain that really showcases all those search features effectively. Here are some options that tick your boxes:

Strong Candidates
Academic/Research Papers - This could be excellent because:

Rich facets: publication year, journal/conference, citation count, field of study, author institution, paper type (survey, empirical, theoretical)
Clear breadcrumb: Computer Science > Machine Learning > Neural Networks > Transformers
Lots of text for snippets with technical terms to highlight
Metadata: authors, citations, DOI, abstract, keywords, published date
Legal Case Database - Very robust for search features:

Facets: jurisdiction, court level, year, case type, judge, outcome
Breadcrumb: Federal > Circuit Court > 9th Circuit > Civil Rights
Rich text excerpts from opinions with legal terminology
Metadata: case number, parties, counsel, related cases
Recipe/Cooking Site - More accessible/fun:

Facets: cuisine type, dietary restrictions, cooking time, difficulty, meal type, main ingredient
Breadcrumb: Recipes > Italian > Pasta > Baked Pasta
Text for instructions and descriptions
Metadata: prep time, servings, calories, ratings, author
Job Listings - Very practical:

Facets: location, salary range, experience level, company size, remote/hybrid/office, posted date, industry
Breadcrumb: Technology Jobs > Software Engineering > Backend Development
Job descriptions with highlightable skills and requirements
Metadata: company, location, posted date, applicants
Real Estate/Property Listings - Familiar to most people:

Facets: price range, bedrooms, bathrooms, property type, neighborhood, year built, lot size
Breadcrumb: San Francisco > Mission District > Condos
Property descriptions with features
Metadata: price, square footage, listing date, agent
Which direction appeals to you? I'm leaning toward academic papers or job listings as they're universally understood and have natural, meaningful facets that people would actually use.

real estate is good,

now think of a good search - something in natural language which would ideally be used to influence filters and boosts - lets brainstorm here for a bit

Great choice! Let's brainstorm some natural language searches that would intelligently map to filters and boosts:

Natural Language Search Ideas
"Family home with yard near good schools under 800k"

Filters: bedrooms ≥3, has yard, price <$800k
Boosts: properties near highly-rated schools, family-friendly neighborhoods
Could trigger "did you mean" for $800k vs 800k
"Walkable downtown condo for young professional"

Filters: property type = condo, downtown areas
Boosts: walk score >70, near transit, nightlife, coffee shops
Highlights: "walkable", "downtown" in descriptions
"Fixer-upper with potential in up-and-coming neighborhood"

Filters: price below market average for area
Boosts: recent area development, needs renovation/TLC mentions
Interesting for snippets showing "investor opportunity", "needs work"
"Pet-friendly apartment near park with parking under 2500/month"

Filters: allows pets, has parking, rent <$2500, proximity to parks
Boosts: dog parks nearby, pet amenities mentioned
Good metadata: pet deposit, parking type
"Quiet suburb home with home office space and big kitchen"

Filters: suburban areas, bedrooms ≥3
Boosts: mentions of office/study, updated kitchen, cul-de-sac
Highlights: "home office", "kitchen", "quiet"
"Modern loft with natural light and open floor plan downtown"

Filters: loft/condo, downtown, recent construction
Boosts: large windows, high ceilings, "bright" mentions
Great for architectural terms to highlight
Which of these feels most realistic and would best showcase your search features? I'm partial to the family home or pet-friendly apartment as they have clear intent with multiple dimensions to parse.

Good examples. Rewrite all of these as pseudo-Lucene queries.

Here are the searches rewritten as pseudo-Lucene queries:

Pseudo-Lucene Query Translations
"Family home with yard near good schools under 800k"

bedrooms:[3 TO *] AND has_yard:true AND price:[* TO 800000] 
AND school_rating:[8 TO 10]^2.0
AND property_type:(house OR single_family)^1.5
"Walkable downtown condo for young professional"

property_type:condo AND location:downtown AND walk_score:[70 TO *]^2.0
AND (transit_distance:[* TO 0.5] OR amenities:(nightlife coffee gym))^1.3
"Fixer-upper with potential in up-and-coming neighborhood"

condition:(fixer needs_work tlc renovation)^1.5 
AND (description:"investor opportunity" OR description:"potential")^1.8
AND neighborhood_trend:rising^2.0
AND price_vs_market:[* TO -10]
"Pet-friendly apartment near park with parking under 2500/month"

pets_allowed:true AND property_type:apartment 
AND rent:[* TO 2500] AND has_parking:true
AND park_distance:[* TO 0.25]^1.5
AND (amenities:dog_park OR description:"pet friendly")^1.3
"Quiet suburb home with home office space and big kitchen"

location_type:suburban AND (bedrooms:[3 TO *] OR description:"office")
AND description:(quiet OR "cul-de-sac" OR peaceful)^1.5
AND (description:"home office" OR description:study)^2.0
AND (description:"updated kitchen" OR description:"large kitchen")^1.8
"Modern loft with natural light and open floor plan downtown"

property_type:loft AND location:downtown 
AND year_built:[2010 TO *]^1.5
AND description:("natural light" OR "bright" OR "windows")^2.0
AND description:("open floor plan" OR "open concept")^1.8
AND (features:high_ceilings OR description:"high ceilings")^1.3
The ^ notation indicates boost factors, ranges use [* TO value] or [value TO *], and I've used field-specific queries with boolean operators. Which approach would you like to feature in the wireframe?

Does this breakdown help? Which fields do you want to emphasize in the wireframe's facets and result cards?

This seems good but let's simplify it considerably. I'm just using this for a demo example. So I want it to be digestible. What are the minimal fields that kind of cross over all of these types of fields and types of use cases?

Perfect! Let's strip this down to the essentials that demonstrate all the key search concepts:

Minimal Field Set (12 fields)
Text Fields (for search matching & highlighting)
title - "Charming Victorian with Bay Views"
description - Full text for snippets with highlighting
Categorical Facets (left sidebar filters)
property_type - house, condo, apartment, townhouse
bedrooms - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5+
neighborhood - Mission District, SOMA, Pacific Heights, etc.
Numerical Range Facets
price - Filter by ranges, sort, display
square_feet - Size filtering
Boolean Facets (checkboxes)
pets_allowed - true/false
has_parking - true/false
Boosting Fields (not shown as facets, but influence ranking)
walk_score - 0-100, boosts "walkable" queries
listing_date - Recency boost
Display Metadata (shown in results)
images - Thumbnail in results
Breadcrumb: San Francisco > [neighborhood] > [property_type]

This gives you:

Facets: property_type, bedrooms, neighborhood, price range, square_feet range, pets_allowed, has_parking
Text search: title + description
Boosting: walk_score, listing_date
Display: title (headline), description (snippet), price, bedrooms, square_feet, images (thumbnail)
That's digestible and demonstrates filtering, text search, boosting, faceting, and result display. Sound good?

Remove number five. Number eight. number 10 and then create a new set of example queries and the associated Lucene queries for example I like the family home matching to number of bedrooms is three or more that was a great idea Yeah. and I like the idea of hot to market or you know recent recently listed automatically mapping to a different boosting on listing date but can be several similar examples

Perfect! Here's the simplified field set and new query examples:

Simplified Field Set (9 fields)
Text Fields
title
description
Categorical Facets
property_type - house, condo, apartment, townhouse
bedrooms - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5+
Numerical Range Facets
price

Example Natural Language Queries → Lucene
"Family home under 800k"

bedrooms:[3 TO *] AND property_type:(house OR townhouse)
AND price:[* TO 800000]
Maps "family" → bedrooms ≥3 + house types
"New listing downtown condo"

property_type:condo AND description:downtown
AND listing_date:[NOW-7DAYS TO NOW]^3.0
Maps "new listing" → recent date boost
"Spacious 2 bedroom with parking"

bedrooms:2 AND square_feet:[1000 TO *]^2.0 AND has_parking:true
Maps "spacious" → square footage boost
"Just listed house"

property_type:house AND listing_date:[NOW-3DAYS TO NOW]^5.0
Maps "just listed" → very recent, heavy boost
"Affordable apartment"

property_type:apartment AND price:[* TO 500000]^1.5
AND (price_rank:[1 TO 25])^2.0
Maps "affordable" → lower price range + boost cheaper listings
"Large home for big family"

bedrooms:[4 TO *] AND square_feet:[2500 TO *]
AND property_type:(house OR townhouse)
Maps "large" + "big family" → 4+ beds, 2500+ sqft
"Hot property fresh on market"

listing_date:[NOW-1DAY TO NOW]^10.0
AND _score:>50
Maps "hot" + "fresh" → brand new listings, extreme recency boost
"Cozy studio with parking under 400k"

bedrooms:[0 TO 1] AND property_type:apartment
AND has_parking:true AND price:[* TO 400000]
Maps "cozy" → studio/1br, "studio" is explicit
"Recently reduced price 3 bedroom"

bedrooms:3 AND price_change_date:[NOW-14DAYS TO NOW]^3.0
AND price_change_percent:[* TO -5]^2.0
Maps "recently reduced" → price drop recency (note: would need price_change_date field, but demonstrates the concept)
"Brand new construction with parking"

description:("new construction" OR "newly built")^3.0
AND listing_date:[NOW-30DAYS TO NOW]^2.0
AND has_parking:true
Maps "brand new construction" → description keywords + recent listing
Which 2-3 of these should we feature in the wireframe? I'm thinking:

"Family home under 800k" - shows smart bedroom mapping
"New listing downtown condo" - shows recency boost
"Spacious 2 bedroom with parking" - shows text interpretation to numerical boost
What would appear in the search results page?

Great question! Let's detail what appears in the search results:

Ready to create the wireframe now?


I've created the wireframe with all the key search components:

**Key Features:**
- **Search box** at the top with the query "family home under 800k"
- **Breadcrumb** navigation (San Francisco > All Neighborhoods > All Property Types)
- **"Did you mean?"** suggestion for query refinement
- **Left sidebar facets** with 5 groups: Property Type, Bedrooms, Price Range, Square Feet, and Amenities
- **Result cards** showing:
  - Property images with "NEW" badges for recent listings
  - Titles with **highlighted** search terms
  - Price prominently displayed
  - Key specs (bedrooms, square feet, property type)
  - Description snippets with **highlighted** matching terms
  - Metadata footer (parking badge, listing date)

The checked facets (House, Townhouse, 3BR, 4+BR, price ranges, sqft ranges) reflect the parsed intent from "family home under 800k". The highlighting shows how search terms are matched in both titles and descriptions.
